"""
Design a sim card store system that gives you 3 sim cards on demand each of which has a 10 digit long phone number.
- The generated numbers should be very hard to predict.
- We need to keep track of the phone numbers that are sold out and also the total unused numbers the system has at any point of time.
- Phone numbers should be stored very efficiently and retrieval of available phone numbers should be fast.
