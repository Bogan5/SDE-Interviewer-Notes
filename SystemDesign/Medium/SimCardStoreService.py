"""
Design a sim card store system that gives you 3 sim cards with completely random phone numbers on demand.
- Phone numbers are 10 digit long and the generated numbers should be hard to predict.
- Phone numbers should be stored very efficiently and retrieval of available phone numbers should be fast.
- At any point in time we should be able to know how many unused numbers the system has.
